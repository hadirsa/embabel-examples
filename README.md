## Embabel agent examples for showcase and testing purposes



Embabel (Em-BAY-bel) is a framework for authoring agentic flows on the JVM that seamlessly mix LLM-prompted interactions
with code and domain models. Supports intelligent path finding towards goals. Written in Kotlin but offers a natural 
usage model from Java. From the creator of Spring.
